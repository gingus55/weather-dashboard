<h3>User Story</h3>

-When I provide the name of a city I am presented with the current weather and a forecast for the next 5 days. 

-When I view the UV index I can see it in a different colour depending on its safety rating.

-After searching a city a history bar is created showing cities I have searched.

-When clicking a city I have previously searched I am immediately given that cities data again. 

-For the current weather and the 5-day forecast I am shown an icon representing the weather.
